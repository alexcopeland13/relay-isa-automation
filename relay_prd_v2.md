# Relay Product Requirements Document (PRD) v2
*Last Updated: April 15, 2025*

## Executive Summary

Relay is an AI-powered Inside Sales Agent (ISA) automation platform designed specifically for EMM Loans, a full-service mortgage lender and real estate company. The system automates lead qualification, follow-up, and nurturing processes that are currently handled manually by human ISAs.

The platform's core value proposition is to dramatically improve lead response time, ensure consistent follow-up, provide accurate lead qualification, and seamlessly transition qualified leads to the appropriate human agents, ultimately increasing conversion rates while reducing operational costs.

This PRD v2 reflects the significant progress made since the project inception, incorporating feedback from EMM Loans and new technical insights gained during Phase 1 implementation. It redefines project requirements and specifications for the next phase of development.

### Project Stakeholders

## Problem Statement

### EMM Loans' Challenges

EMM Loans faces several operational challenges in their lead management process:

1. **Response Time Gaps**: Human ISAs cannot respond to all leads immediately, resulting in potential missed opportunities due to delayed follow-up.

2. **Inconsistent Follow-up**: Manual tracking of follow-up activities leads to inconsistent execution, with approximately 30-40% of follow-ups falling through the cracks.

3. **Inefficient Resource Allocation**: Highly skilled ISAs spend significant time on routine qualification tasks rather than focusing on complex cases and closing deals.

4. **Lead-Agent Matching Inefficiency**: The process of matching qualified leads to the appropriate real estate agents lacks precision, resulting in suboptimal pairings.

5. **Limited Scalability**: The current manual process cannot efficiently scale with business growth without proportional headcount increases.

6. **Data Capture Inconsistency**: Information collected during initial conversations varies based on the ISA, creating downstream challenges for lead nurturing.

### Industry Context

The mortgage and real estate industry is increasingly competitive, with response time being a critical factor in conversion success. Research indicates that leads contacted within 5 minutes are 21x more likely to convert than those contacted after 30 minutes. Additionally, the industry faces:

- Rising customer expectations for immediate assistance
- Increased competition from digital-first mortgage providers
- Fluctuating market conditions requiring adaptive qualification approaches
- Growing importance of personalization in customer interactions

### User Needs Analysis

Through extensive interviews with EMM Loans staff and analysis of their current workflows, we've identified these key user needs:

1. **ISA Team Needs**:
   - Automation of routine qualification tasks
   - Tools to prioritize follow-up activities
   - Better visibility into lead status and history
   - Assistance with lead-to-agent matching

2. **Management Needs**:
   - Comprehensive analytics on lead flow and conversion
   - Visibility into conversation quality and outcomes
   - ROI measurement for marketing initiatives
   - Resource optimization insights

3. **Real Estate Agents & Loan Officers Needs**:
